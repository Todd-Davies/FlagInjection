This is a framework for automatically detecting flagged variables, parsing them with Apache CLI, and injecting them with Guice.

See the example class for examples, but the key thing is that you annotate variables with @Flag, pass classes with flagged variables to Flags.flagBindings, and bootstrap a Guice module that'll do all the desired injection using Flags.bootstrapFlagInjector.
